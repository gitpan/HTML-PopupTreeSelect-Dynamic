HTML::PopupTreeSelect::Dynamic version 1.2
==========================================

This module provides a dynamic version of HTML::PopupTreeSelect.  By
dynamic I mean that the tree is sent to the client in chunks as the
user clicks around the tree.  In HTML::PopupTreeSelect the entire tree
is sent to the client when the page is loaded, introducing a long
delay for large trees.  With HTML::PopupTreeSelect::Dynamic trees of
virtually any size can be navigated without noticable delays.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Then copy the images in images/ into a place here your web server can
find them.  Remember where you put them so you'll know what value to
set for image_path when you call new().
